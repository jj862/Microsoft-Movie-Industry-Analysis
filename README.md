# Current Movie Industry Analysis

**Author**: Jonah Devoy

## Overview

For my exploratory data analysis project, I have been tasked with using exploratory data analysis to generate insights for business stakeholders. My goal for this project was to investigate what genre of films is the most profitable and deliver these findings to Microsoft's new movie studio executives. The analysis results, shown by visualizations and descriptive statistics revealed the most profitable movie genres and recommended the best directors to hire for each genre. Microsoft's new movie studio can use my report to produce movies that accumulate the highest profit and tailor those movies to specific genres and what directors are the best to use for each of those selected genres.

## Business Problem

It was brought to my attention that Microsoft has noticed other big enterprises creating original video content and they would like to enter the exciting world of movie-making with their new movie studio. One problem is that Microsoft is uncertain of where to start. I have been recruited with exploring what types of films Microsofts new movie studio should produce to be successful. Using my findings I transformed those results into actionable insights so that Microsoft's new movie studio will have direction to be profitable. To aid Microsofts studio, I looked at the highest-profiting genre of movies, which genre of movies should be produced, and what directors to use for the selected genres. The three factors I based my analysis on are:
* What movie genres produce the highest profits?
* What movie genres should be produced to avoid competition?
* What director should be hired to produce their movies?


## Data

I used two data sources for my analysis to determine the best recommendations for Microsofts new movie studio.
* tn.movie_budgets.csv: This compressed csv was extracted from the zipped data folder provided in the dsc-phase-1-project-v2-4.git Github repository located at https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-phase-1-project-v2-4.git. I forked the repository and extracted all the files to my local machine where I could work on the tn.movie_budgets.csv on my local machine's Jupyter Notebook.
* imdb_top_1000.csv: This data set is taken from Kaggles EDA on IMDB Movies Dataset located at https://www.kaggle.com/code/harshitshankhdhar/eda-on-imdb-movies-dataset/notebook. I downloaded the data to my local machine and moved the csv file to the zipped data folder with the rest of the given csv files. I chose to utilize this data set because of the information it gave such as movie directors, top four stars per movie, and gross income of the movie.


## Results

* The results indicate that the highest proffiting genres are Adventure, Action, Family, Fantasy and Animation.
* The results indicate that Action and Adventure are genres relased often in the 21st century. Fantasy
Animation and Family are genred that are not oversaturated in the market.
* The findings indicate that for action, fantasy and adventure movies James Cameron should be hired as director. For Animation movies Brad Bird should be hired, and for Family movies Microsoft should recruit Mike Newell
